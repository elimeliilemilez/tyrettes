Portfolio website.

This is a website made for the sole purpose of functioning as an archive and viewport of my works. A portfolio, of sorts.

I have had a desire to learn and create since I was a little kid, and though I have no professional training, I do think I've picked up on some things over time :)

I can also be found in these places, should you want to contact me:
