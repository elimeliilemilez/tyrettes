        <p>Hello! This is my humble homepage, which is mostly to collect some basic info and links in one nice little place. I'm a hobbyist artist and writer, somewhat a novice programmer, and overall a person who enjoys doing various creative things.</p>

        <p>If you're only here to learn about me as a person, you can <a class="fancy" href="/about.html">go to my about me page here</a>.</p>

        <p>Currently, my recent major project is my poetry collection, <i>Walk With Me Without Me</i>. It is about the journey through trauma, told in 15 deeply personal and very atmospheric poems. The link is in the buttons below, and it is sold as pay what you want, from $0 and up. A variety of other works, most of them of the visual arts, are available on my DeviantArt.</p>

        <p>If you wish to support me, you can do so either by paying what you want for my poetry collection, submitting a donation over at Ko-Fi, buying something in my RedBubble store, or requesting a comission. <i>(Note: Due to my health, I am not always able to accept comissions. Still, feel free to ask, as I consider every request on a case by case basis.)</i></p>

        <p>I send out updates on my projects every now and then â€” you may subscribe to those below. Any other inquiries you may have can be submitted through the contact form.</p>
